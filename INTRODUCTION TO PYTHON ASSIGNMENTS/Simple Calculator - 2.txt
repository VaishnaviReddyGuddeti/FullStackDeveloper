QUESTION:

Simple Calculator - 2:
Write a program to create a menu-driven calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /, and %).

Input:

The input will be a single line containing two integers and operator(+, -, *, /, and %) similar to 3 + 5.

Output:

If the given operator is "+", print the sum of two numbers.
If the given operator is "-", print the result of the subtraction of the two numbers.
If the given operator is "*", print the multiplication of the two numbers.
If the given operator is "/", print the result of the division of the two numbers.
If the given operator is "%", print the result of the modulus operation of the two numbers.

Explanation:

For example, if the given operator is "+" and the two numbers are 3 and 5. As it is an addition operator, your code should print the sum of the given two numbers (3 + 5), which is 8.
Similarly, if the given operator is "*" and the two numbers are 2 and 5.
As it is a multiplication operator, your code should print the result of the multiplication of the given two numbers (2 * 5), which is 10.
Similarly, if the given operator is "-" and the two numbers are 10 and 9.
As it is a subtraction operator, your code should print the result of the subtraction of the given two numbers (10 - 9), which is 1.

Sample Input 1:
8

Sample Output 1:

Sample Input 2:
2  *  5

Sample Output 2:
10 

Sample Input 3:
10 - 9

Sample Output 3:
1 

CODE:

def IsInt(str):
    try:
        int(str)
        return True 
    except ValueError:
        return False
txt = input()
fields = txt.split()
operand1 = int(fields[0])
operand2 = int(fields[2])
if fields[1] == '+':
    result = operand1 + operand2 
elif fields[1] == '-':
    result = operand1 - operand2 
elif fields[1] == '*':
    result = operand1 * operand2 
elif fields[1] == '/':
    result = operand1 / operand2 
elif fields[1] == '%':
    result = operand1 % operand2 
print(result)
