QUESTION:

First Perfect Square:
Given two integers (M and N), write a program to print the first perfect square in a given range.

Input:

The first line of input will contain a positive integer (M).
The second line of input will contain a positive integer (N).

Output:

The output should be a single line containing the first perfect square in a given range.

Explanation:

For example, if the given numbers are M is 4 and N is 16, the perfect squares from 4 to 16 are 4(2 * 2), 9(3 * 3), and 16(4 * 4), as the first perfect square is 4. So the output should be 4.

Sample Input 1:
4
16

Sample Output 1:
4

Sample Input 2:
5
8

Sample Output 2:
No Perfect Square


CODE:

def Squares(a, b):
    for i in range (a, b + 1):
        j = 1;
        while j * j <= i:
            if j * j == i:
                 yield j*j
            j = j + 1
        i = i + 1
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
x = [v for v in Squares(a,b)]
if x:
    print(min(x))
else:
    print("No Perfect Square")
