QUESTION:


Smallest Missing Number:
Given a list of numbers, write a program to print the smallest positive integer missing in the given numbers.

Input:

The input will be a single line containing numbers separated by space.

Output:

The output should be a single line containing the smallest missing number from given numbers.

Explanation:

For example, if the input numbers are 3, 1, 2, 5, 3, 7, 7.
The number 1, 2, 3 are present. But the number 4 is not. So 4 is the smallest positive integers that is missing from the given numbers.

Sample Input 1:
3 1 2 5 3 7 7

Sample Output 1:
4  

Sample Input 2:
5 5 2 3 1 8 8 4

Sample Output 2:
6 


CODE:


numbers = input()

numberListStr = numbers.split(' ')
numberListInt = [int(number) for number in numberListStr]

smallestMissing = 1

while True:
    if smallestMissing not in numberListInt:
        
        break
    smallestMissing += 1

print(smallestMissing)
