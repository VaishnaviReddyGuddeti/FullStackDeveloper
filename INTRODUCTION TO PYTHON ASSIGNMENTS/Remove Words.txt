QUESTION:

Remove Words:
Given a string, write a program to remove all the words with K length.

Input:

The first line of the input will contain a string A.
The second line of the input will contain an integer K.

Output:

The output should contain a string after removing all the words whose length is equal to K.

Explanation:

For example, string A is "Tea is good for you", k is 3 then output should be "is good."
Here words "Tea", "for", "you" length is equal to 3, so these words are removed from string.

Sample Input 1:
Tea is good for you
3

Sample Output 1:
is good

Sample Input 2:
A ganga stood in fron of me
2

Sample Output 2:
A gang stood front


CODE:

A = input().split()
k = int(input())
B = []
for i in range(len(A)):
    if len(A[i]) != k:
        B.append(A[i])
print(end = "")
for i in range(len(B)):
    print(B[i], end = " ")
print()
