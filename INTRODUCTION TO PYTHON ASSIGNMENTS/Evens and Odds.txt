QUESTION:

Evens and Odds:
Write a program to count even and odd numbers in given range [M, N]. Both M, N are inclusive in [M, N].

Input:
The first line of the input will be an integer(M).
The Second line of the input will be an integer(N).

Output:

The first line of output should be a number of odds count.
The second line of output should be a number of even counts.

Explanation:
For example, if the given range is 2 to 11 
odds numbers in the range are 3, 5, 7, 9, 11 then count is 5.
even numbers in the range are 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 then count is 5.

Sample Input 1:
2
11

Sample Output 1:
5
5

Sample Input 2:
-5
7

Sample Output 2:
7
6

CODE:

M = int(input())
N = int(input())

count_odds = 0
count_even = 0

for i in range(M, N+1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        count_even += 1
    else:
        count_odds += 1

print(count_odds)
print(count_even)
