QUESTION:

Ordered Matrix:
Given a M x N matrix, write a program to print the matrix after ordering all the elements of the matrix in increasing order.

Input:

The first line of input will contain two space-separated integers, denoting the M and N.
The next M following lines will contain N space-separated integers, denoting the elements of each list.

Output:

The output should be M lines containing the ordered matrix.
Note: There is a space at the end of each line.

Explanation:

For example, if the given M is 3 and N is 3, read the inputs in the next three lines if the numbers given in the next three lines are the following.
1 20 3
30 10 2
5 11 15

By ordering all the elements of the matrix in increasing order, the ordered matrix should be
1 2 3
5 10 11
15 20 30

Sample Input 1:
3 3
1 20 3
30 10 2
5 11 15

Sample Output 1:
1 2 3 
5 10 11 
15 20 30 

Sample Input 2:
2 5
-50 20 3 25 -20
88 17 38 72 -10

Sample Output 2:
-50 -20 -10 3 17 
20 25 38 72 88 


CODE:

m, n = list(map(int, input().split()))

matrix = []
for i in range(m):
    input_list = list(map(int, input().split()))
    matrix += input_list
matrix.sort()

index = 0
for i in range(m):
    pattern = ''
    for j in range(n):
        pattern += str(matrix[index]) + ' '
        index += 1
    print(pattern)
