QUESTION:

Secret Message - 2:
Given a string, write a program to print a secret message that replaces characters with numbers 'a' with 1, 'b' with 2, ..., 'z' with 26 where characters are separated by '-'.

Note: You need to replace both uppercase and lowercase characters. You can ignore replacing all characters that are not letters.

a	b	c	d	e	f	g	h	i	j
1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10

k	l	m	n	o	p	q	r
11	12	13	14	15	16	17	18

s	t	u	v	w	x	y	z
19	20	21	22	23	24	25	26

Input:

The input will be a string in the single line containing spaces and letters (both uppercase and lowercase).

Output:

The output should be a single line containing the secret message. All characters in the output should be in lower case.

Explanation:

For example, if the given input is "python", "p" should replaced with "16", similarly"y" with "25","t" with "20","h" with "8","o" with "15","n" with "14". So the output should be "16-25-20-8-15-14".

Sample Input 1:
python

Sample Output 1:
16-25-20-8-15-14

Sample Input 2:
Foundations

Sample Output 2:
16-25-20-8-15-14-4-1-20-9-15-14-19 

CODE:

input_word = input().lower()

output = ''
for i in input_word:
    if i.isalpha():
        output += str(ord(i) - 96) + '-'
    else:
        output = output[:-1]
        output += i
print(output[:-1])
