QUESTON:

Sum of Non-Primes:
Write a program to print the sum of non-primes in the given N numbers. The numbers which are not primes are considered as non-primes.

Input:
The first line of input will contain a positive integer (N).
The following N lines will contain an integer in each line.

Output:
The output should be the sum of non-primes in the given numbers.

Explanation:
For example, if the given number is 5, then read the inputs in the next 5 lines and print the sum of non-primes in the given five numbers. If the given input integers in the next five lines are 8, 11, 96, 49, and 25 the output should be 8 + 96 + 49 + 25 is 178.

Sample Input 1:
5 
8
11
96
49
25

Sample Output 1:
178

Sample Input 2:
2
4
2

Sample Output 2:
4

    for char in str_list:
        char = int(char)

        for j in range(2, char):
            if char % j == 0:
                new_list.add(char)
    return new_list 
n = int(input())
list_a = []
for i in range(n):
    num = int(input())
    list_a.append(num)
str_list = list_a 
int_list = convert_list_to_int(str_list)
int_list = list(int_list)
print(sum(int_list))
