QUESTION:

Prefix Suffix:
Write a program to check the overlapping of one string's suffix with the prefix of another string.

Input:

The first line of the input will contain a string A.
The second line of the input will contain a string B.

Output:

The output should contain overlapping word if present else print "No overlapping".

Explanation:

For example, if the given two strings, A and B, are "ramisgood" "goodforall" 
The output should be "good" as good overlaps as a suffix of the first string and prefix of next.

Sample Input 1:

ramisgood
goodforall

Sample Output 1:

good

Sample Input 2:

finally
restforall

Sample Output 2:

No overlapping


CODE:

n = input()
m = input()
for i in range(len(n)):
    s = ""
    if m.startswith(n[i:]):
        s+=n[i:]
        break 
if s=="":
    print("No overlapping")
else:
    print(s)
