QUESTION:

New Year Countdown:
Given date-time D, write a program to print the time left for the next New Year.

Input:

The input will be a single line containing the date-time in the string format similar to "Dec 30 2020 02:43 PM".

Output:

The output should be a single line containing hours and minutes left for the next new year in the format similar to "33 hours 17 minutes".

Explanation:

For example, if the given date-time is "Dec 30 2020 02:43 PM", the difference between "Dec 30 2020 02:43 PM" and "Jan 1 2021 00:00 AM" is 1 day 9 hours 17 minutes. The difference in hours and minutes is  1 * 24 + 9 hours and 17 minutes. So the output should be "33 hours 17 minutes".

Sample Input 1:
Dec 30 2020 02:43 PM

Sample Output 1:
33 ours 17 minutes

Sample Input 2:
Jan 31 2020 04:43 AM

Sample Output 2:
8059 hours 17 minutes


CODE:

from datetime import datetime
date = datetime.strptime(input(), '%b %d %Y %I:%M %p')
new_year = date.strptime('Jan 1 ' + str(date.year + 1), '%b %d %Y')
days = (new_year - date).days
hours = days * 24 + 23 - date.hour
minutes = 60 - date.minute
print('{} hours {} minutes'.format(hours, minutes))
