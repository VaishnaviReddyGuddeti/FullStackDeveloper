*DATA: Any sort of information that is stored is called data.
Examples:
-Messages & multimedia on WhatsApp
-Products and orders on Amazon
-Contact details in telephone directory, etc.

*Database: An organised collection of data is called a database.

*Types of Databases:
There are different types of databases based on how we organize the data. 
1. Relational Database : In relational databases, the data is organised in the form of tables.
2. Non-Relational Database : These four types are commonly referred as non-relational databases.
       -Graph
       -Key Value
       -Column Family
       -Document

Note:
-Choice of database depends on our requirements.
-Relational database is the most commonly used database.

*Relational DBMS: A Relational DBMSis a DBMS designed specifically for relational databases. Relational databases organise the data in the form of tables.
 Examples: Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, SQL Server, IBM DB2, etc.
       
*Non-Relational DBMS : A Non-relational DBMSis a DBMS designed specifically for non-relational databases. Non-relational databases store the data in a non-tabular form.
 Examples: Elasticsearch, CouchDB, DynamoDB, MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, etc.
