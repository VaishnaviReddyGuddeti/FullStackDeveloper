*Modelling Databases: Part 1*
To model a database, we have to first understand the business requirements at conceptual level, which is later translated into a relational database.

For understanding the business requirements at a conceptual level, we useEntity Relationship Model (ER Model).

Core Concepts in ER Model
Entity:Real world objects/concepts are called entities in ER Model.

Attributes of an Entity:Properties of real world objects/concepts are represented as attributes of an entity in ER model.

Key Attribute:The attribute that uniquely identifies each entity is called key attribute.

Entity Type:Entity Type is a collection of entities that have the same attributes (not values).

Relationships:
Association among the entities is called a relationship.

Example:
-Person has a passport.
-Person can have many cars.
-Each student can register for many courses, and a course can have many students.

Types of relationships:
-One-to-One Relationship
-One-to-Many or Many-to-One Relationship
-Many-to-Many Relationship

One-to-One Relationship:
An entity is related to only one entity, and vice versa.
Example:
-A person can have only one passport.
-similarly, a passport belongs to one and only one person.

One-to-Many Relationship:
An entity is related to many other entities.
Example:
-A person can have many cars. But a car belongs to only one person.

Many-to-Many Relationship:
Multiple entities are related to multiple entities.
Example:
-Each student can register to multiple courses.
-similarly each course is taken by multiple students.

Cardinality Ratio:
Cardinality in DBMS defines the maximum number of times an instance in one entity can relate to instances of another entity.

Applying ER Model Concepts:
In the previous cheatsheet, we have understood the core concepts of ER Model â€” entity types, relationships and attributes. Now, let's build an ER model for a real-world scenario.
