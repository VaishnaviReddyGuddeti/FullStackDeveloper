Comparison Operators:
In a typical e-commerce scenario, users would generally filter the products with good ratings, or want to purchase the products of a certain brand or of a certain price.
Let's see how comparison operators are used to filter such kind of data using the following database.

Comparison Operators:
Operator	   Description
=	            Equal to
<>	        Not equal to
<          Less than
<=	       Less than or equal to
>	         Greater than
>=	       Greater than or equal to


String Operations:
Consider the case of e-commerce platforms. We generally search for the products on the basis of product name. But while searching, we need not enter the full name. For example, typing “mobiles” in a search bar will fetch thousands of results. How to get the data on the basis of only a part of the string? Let’s learn about it!

Database :
The database contains aproducttable that stores the data of products like name, category, price, brand and rating.
You can check the schema and data ofproducttable in the code playground.

LIKE Operator:
LIKEoperator is used to perform queries on strings. This operator is especially used inWHEREclause to retrieve all the rows that match the given pattern.

We writepatternsusing the followingwildcard characters:

Symbol	               Description	                                      Example
Percent sign (%)	     Represents zero or more characters	           ch%finds ch, chips, chocolate..
Underscore (_)	       Represents a single character	              _atfinds mat, hat and bat

Syntax
SQL:
SELECT
    *
FROM
    table_name
WHERE
    c1 LIKE matching_pattern;
    
Note:
The percent sign(%) is used when we are not sure of the number of characters present in the string.
If we know the exact length of the string, then the wildcard character underscore(_) comes in handy.

Logical Operators:
So far, we've used comparison operators to filter the data. But in real-world scenarios, we often have to retrieve the data using several conditions at once. For example, in the case of e-commerce platforms, users often search for something like:
Get shoes from the Puma brand, which have ratings greater than 4.0 and price less than 5000.

With logical operators, we can perform queries based on multiple conditions. Let's learn how with the following database.

Database:
The database contains aproducttable that stores the data of products like name, category, price, brand and rating.
You can check the schema and data ofproducttable in the code playground.

AND, OR, NOT:
Operator	Description
AND	    Used to fetch rows that satisfy two or more conditions.
OR	    Used to fetch rows that satisfy at least one of the given conditions.
NOT	    Used to negate a condition in theWHEREclause.

Syntax
SQL:
SELECT
  *
FROM
  table_name
WHERE
  condition1
  operator condition2
  operator condition3
  ...;
  
Multiple Logical Operators:
We can also use the combinations of logical operators to combine two or more conditions. These compound conditions enable us to fine-tune the data retrieval requirements. 

Precedence:
->When a query has multiple operators, operator precedence determines the sequence of operations.

Order of precedence:
NOT
AND
OR

Example:
Fetch the products that belong to

Redmi brandandratinggreater than 4 or
the products from OnePlus brand

SQL:
SELECT
  *
FROM
  product
WHERE
  brand = "Redmi"
  AND rating > 4
  OR brand = "OnePlus";
  
Quick Tip:
It is suggested to always use parenthesis to ensure correctness while grouping the conditions.

IN and BETWEEN Operators:
Consider the case of a typical e-commerce scenario. Users generally search for the products that belong to a list of brands, or the products that lie within a particular price range. 

In such scenarios, we use the IN operator to check if a value is present in the list of values. And, BETWEEN operator is used to check if a particular value exists in the given range.

Let’s learn about these operators in detail using the following database.

Database:
The database contains aproducttable that stores the data of products like name, category, price, brand and rating.
You can check the schema and data ofproducttable in the code playground.

IN Operator:
Retrieves the corresponding rows from the table if the value of column(c1) is present in the given values(v1,v2,..).

Syntax
SQL:
SELECT
  *
FROM
  table_name
WHERE
  c1 IN (v1, v2,..);
 
BETWEEN Operator:
Retrieves all the rows from table that have cloumn(c1) value present between the given range(v1 and v2).

Syntax
SQL:
SELECT
  *
FROM
  table_name
WHERE
  c1 BETWEEN v1
  AND v2;
  
Note:
BETWEENoperator is inclusive, i.e., both the lower and upper limit values of the range are included.

Possible Mistakes:
1.When using theBETWEENoperator, the first value should be less than second value. If not, we'll get an incorrect result depending on the DBMS.
SQL:
SELECT
  name,
  price,
  brand
FROM
  product
WHERE
  price BETWEEN 500
  AND 300;
  
2.We have to give both lower limit and upper limit while specifying range.
SQL:
SELECT
  name,
  price,
  brand
FROM
  product
WHERE
  price BETWEEN
  AND 300;
  
3.The data type of the column for which we're using theBETWEENoperator must match with the data types of the lower and upper limits.
SQL:
SELECT
  name,
  price,
  brand
FROM
  product
WHERE
  name BETWEEN 300
  AND 500;
