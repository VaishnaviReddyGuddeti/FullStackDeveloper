Transactions:
A transaction is a logical group of one or more SQL statements.

Transactions are used in various scenarios such as banking, ecommerce, social networks, booking tickets, etc.

A transaction has four important properties.
-Atomicity
-Consistency
-Isolation
-Durability

Atomicity:
Either all SQL statements or none are applied to the database.

Consistency:
Transactions always leave the database in a consistent state.

Isolation:
Multiple transaction can occur at the same time without adversely affecting the other.

Durability:
Changes of a successful transaction persist even after a system crash.
These four properties are commonly acronymed as ACID.
A-Automatic 
C-Consistency
I-Isolation
D-Durable

Indexes:
In scenarios like, searching for a word in dictionary, we use index to easily search for the word. Similarly, in databases, we maintain indexes to speed up the search for data in a table.
