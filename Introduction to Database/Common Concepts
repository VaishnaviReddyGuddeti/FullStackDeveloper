Expressions in Querying:
We can write expressions in various SQL clauses. Expressions can comprise of various data types like integers, floats, strings, datetime, etc. 

Let's learn more about expressions using the following database.

Database:
The IMDb stores various movies, actors and cast information.

Using Expressions in SELECT Clause:
1.Get profits of all movies.
Note: Consider profit as the difference between collection and budget.
SQL:
SELECT 
    id, name, (collection_in_cr-budget_in_cr) as profit
FROM
    movie;
    
Note:
We use "||" operator to concatenate strings in sqlite3

2.Get the movienameandgenrein the following format:movie_name - genre.
SQL:
SELECT
  name || " - " || genre AS movie_genre
FROM
  movie;
  
Using Expressions in WHERE Clause:
1.Get all the movies with a profit of at least 50 crores.
SQL:
SELECT
   *
FROM
   movie
WHERE
   (collection_in_cr - budget_in_cr) >= 50;
   
Using Expressions in UPDATE Clause:
1.Scale down ratings from 10 to 5 in movie table.
SQL:
UPDATE movie
SET rating = rating/2;

Expressions in HAVING Clause:
Get all the genres that have average profit greater than 100 crores.

SQL:
SELECT
  genre
FROM
  movie
GROUP BY
  genre
HAVING
  AVG(collection_in_cr - budget_in_cr) >= 100;
  
SQL Functions:
 SQL provides many built-in functions to perform various operations over data that is stored in tables.
Let's look at a few most commonly used functions in the industry using the following database.

Database:
The IMDb dataset stores the information of movies, actors and cast.

Date Functions:
strftime()
strftime() function is used to extract month, year, etc. from a date/datetime field based on a specified format.

Syntax:SQL
strftime(format, field_name)

Example:
Get the movie title and release year for every movie in the database 

SQL:
SELECT name, strftime('%Y', release_date)
FROM
    movie;

In the above query, we extract year from release_date by writing strftime('%Y', release_date) in SELECT clause.

Example:
Get the number of movies released in each month of the year 2010

SQL:
SELECT 
    strftime('%m', release_date) as month,
    COUNT(*) as total_movies
FROM
    movie
WHERE
    strftime('%Y', release_date) = '2010'
GROUP BY
    strftime('%m', release_date);
    
CAST Function:
CAST function is used to typecast a value to a desired data type.

Syntax
SQL:
CAST(value AS data_type);

Example:
Get the number of movies released in each month of the year 2010

SQL:
SELECT strftime('%m', release_date) as month,
        COUNT(*) as total_movies
FROM
    movie
WHERE
    CAST(strftime('%Y', release_date) AS INTEGER) = 2010
GROUP BY
    strftime('%m', release_date);
    
Here,CAST(strftime('%Y', release_date) AS INTEGER) converts the year in string format to integer format. 

Other Common Functions:
Arithmetic Functions:
SQL Function	         Behavior
FLOOR	Rounds          a number to the nearest integer below its current value
CEIL	Rounds          a number to the nearest integer above its current value
ROUND	Rounds          a number to a specified number of decimal places

Examples:
Fetch the ceil, floor and round (to 1 decimal) values of the collections of all movies.
SQL:
SELECT
    name,
  ROUND(collection_in_cr, 1) AS RoundedValue,
  CEIL(collection_in_cr) AS CeilValue,
  FLOOR(collection_in_cr) AS FloorValue
FROM
  movie;
  
String Functions:
SQL Function	             Behavior
UPPER	                Converts a string to upper case
LOWER               	Converts a string to lower case

When you are not sure about the case (upper/lower) of the movie name, you can write a query as below to search for all the avengers movies irrespective of the case. 

SQL:
SELECT
   name
FROM
  movie
  WHERE UPPER(name) LIKE UPPER("%avengers%");
  
Note:
Usually, UPPER() AND LOWER() functions can help you to perform case-insensitive searches.

CASE Clause:
SQL provides CASE clause to perform conditional operations. This is similar to the switch case / if-else conditions in other programming languages.

Let's learn more about the usage of CASE clause using the given database

Database:
The IMDb dataset which consists of movies, actors and cast.

CASE Clause:
Each condition in the CASE clause is evaluated and results in corresponding value when the first condition is met.

Syntax
SQL:
SELECT c1, c2
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN value1
    WHEN condition2 THEN value2
    ...
    ELSE value
    END AS cn
FROM table;

Note:
1.In CASE clause, if no condition is satisfied, it returns the value in the ELSE part. If we do not specify the ELSE part, CASE clause results in NULL

2.We can use CASE in various clauses like SELECT, WHERE, HAVING, ORDER BY and GROUP BY.

Example:
Calculate the tax amount for all movies based on the profit. Check the following table for tax percentages.

profit	              tax_percentage
<=100 crores	         10% of profit
100< <=500 crores    	 15% of profit
> 500 crores	         18% of profit

SQL:
SELECT id, name,
  CASE
    WHEN collection_in_cr - budget_in_cr <= 100 THEN collection_in_cr - budget_in_cr * 0.1
    WHEN (collection_in_cr - budget_in_cr > 100
    AND collection_in_cr - budget_in_cr < 500) THEN collection_in_cr - budget_in_cr * 0.15
    ELSE collection_in_cr - budget_in_cr * 0.18
  END AS tax_amount
FROM
  movie;
  
CASE with Aggregates:
CASE statements can also be used together with aggregate functions

Example:
Get the number of movies with rating greater than or equal to 8, and the movies with rating less than 8, and are released between 2015 and 2020.
 
SQL:
SELECT
  count(
    CASE
      WHEN rating >= 8 THEN 1
    END
  ) AS above_eight,
  count(
    CASE
      WHEN rating < 8 THEN 1
    END
  ) AS below_eight
FROM
  movie
WHERE
  CAST(strftime("%Y", release_date) AS INTEGER) BETWEEN 2015
  AND 2020;
