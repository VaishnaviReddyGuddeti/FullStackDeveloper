Take Input From User:
input() allows flexibility to take the input from the user.
Reads a line of input as a string.

Code:
username = input()
print(username)
Input:
Sushanth
Output:
Sushanth

Working with Strings:
String Concatenation:
Joining strings together is called string concatenation.

Code:
a = "Hello" + " " + "World"
print(a)
Output:
Hello World

Concatenation Errors:
String Concatenation is possible only with strings.

Code:
a = "*" + 10
print(a)
Output:
File "main.py", line 1
    a = "*" + 10
    ^
TypeError: 
can only concatenate str (not "int") to str 

String Repetition:
(* )operator is used for repeating strings any number of times as required.

Code:
a = "*" * 10
print(a)
Output:
**********

Code:
s = "Python"
s = ("* " * 3) + s + (" *" * 3)
print(s)
Output:
* * * Python *

Length of String:
len() returns the number of characters in a given string.

Code:
username = input()
length = len(username)
print(length)
Input:
Shourya
Output:
7 

String Indexing:
We can access an individual character in a string using their positions (which start from 0) .
These positions are also called as index.

Code:
username = "Shourya"
first_letter = username[0]
print(first_letter)
Output:
S

IndexError:
Attempting to use an index that is too large will result in an error:

Code:
username = "Ravi"
print(username[4])
Output:
IndexError: string index out of range
