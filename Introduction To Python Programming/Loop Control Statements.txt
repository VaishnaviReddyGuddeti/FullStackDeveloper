Nested Loops:
An inner loop within the repeating block of an outer loop is called Nested Loop.

The Inner Loop will be executed one time for each iteration of the Outer Loop.
Code:
for i in range(2):
  print("Outer: " + str(i))
  for j in range(2):
    print(" Inner: " + str(j))
Output:
Outer: 0
 Inner: 0
 Inner: 1
Outer: 1
 Inner: 0
 Inner: 1

Nested Repeating Block:
The one highlighted in the blue dotted line is the repeating block of the inner loop.
Code:
for i in range(2):
  print("Outer: " + str(i))
  for j in range(2):
    print(" Inner: " + str(j))
print("END")

In the above example, the below line is the repeating block of the nested loop.

Code:
print(" Inner: " + str(j))
Output:
Outer: 0
 Inner: 0
 Inner: 1
Outer: 1
 Inner: 0
 Inner: 1
END

Examples - Nested Loops:
Example - 1: While loop inside a For loop
Example - 2: While loop inside a while loop

Loop Control Statements:
Control statements alter the sequential execution of a program.

Examples:

-if-elif-else
-while, for
-break, continue

Break:
Break statement makes the program exit a loop early.
Using Break:
Generally, break is used to exit a loop when a condition is satisfied.
In the below example, when the variable i value equals to 3 the break statement gets executed and stops the execution of the loop further.

Code:
for i in range(5):
  if i == 3:
    break
  print(i)
print("END")
Output:
0
1
2
END

Break in Nested Loop:
Break in inner loop stops the execution of the inner loop.

Continue:
Continue makes the program skip the remaining statements in the current iteration and begin the next iteration.
### Using Continue
Generally, continue is used to skip the remaining statements in the current iteration when a condition is satisfied.
In the below example, when the variable i value equals to 3 the next statements in the loop body are skipped.

Code:
for i in range(5):
  if i == 3:
    continue
  print(i)
print("END")
Output:
0
1
2
4
END

Pass:
Pass statement is used as a syntactic placeholder. When it is executed, nothing happens.
Generally used when we have to test the code before writing the complete code.
### Empty Loops
We can use pass statements to test code written so far, before writing loop logic.
