*Nested Conditional Statements*
Nested Conditions:
The conditional block inside another if/else conditional block is called as nested conditional block.
In the below example, Block 2 is nested conditional block and condition B is called nested conditional statement.
Code:
matches_won = int(input())
goals = int(input())
if matches_won > 8:
    if goals > 20:
        print("Hurray")
    print("Winner")
Input:
10
22
Output:
Hurray
Winner
Input:
10
18
Output:
Winner

Nested Condition in Else Block:
We can also write nested conditions in Else Statement.

In the below example Block 2 is a nested conditional block.
Code:
a = 2
b = 3
c = 1
is_a_greatest = (a > b) and (a > c)
if is_a_greatest:
    print(a)
else:
    is_b_greatest = (b > c)
    if is_b_greatest:
        print(b)
    else:
        print(c)
Output:
3

Elif Statement:
Use the elif statement to have multiple conditional statements between if and else.

The elif statement is optional.

Multiple Elif Statements:
We can add any number of elif statements after if conditional block.

Execution of Elif Statement:
Python will execute the elif block whose expression evaluates to true.
If multiple elif conditions are true, then only the first elif block which is True will be executed.

Optional Else Statement:
Else statement is not compulsory after if - elif statements.
Code:
number = 5
is_divisible_by_10 = (number % 10 == 0)
is_divisible_by_5 = (number % 5 == 0)
if is_divisible_by_10:
    print("Divisible by 10")
elif is_divisible_by_5:
    print("Divisible by 5")
else:
   print("Not Divisible by 10 or 5")
Output:
Divisible by 5

Possible Mistake:
Cannot write an elif statement after else statement.
