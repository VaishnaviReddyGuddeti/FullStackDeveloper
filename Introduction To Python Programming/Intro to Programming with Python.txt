Intro to Programming with Python
Software:

Software is a set of instructions to the hardware.

Programming:

Programming means writing the instructions to create a software.

Code:

The instructions that we write to create software is called Code.

Syntax:

Similar to Grammar rules in English, Hindi, each programming language has a unique set of rules. These rules are called the Syntax of a Programming Language.

Why Python?
Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. With Python, it is possible to create programs with minimal amount of code. Look at the code in Java and Python used for printing the message "Hello World"

Java-code:
class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World");
    }
}
Python-Code:
print("Hello World")

Applications of Python
Python is a versatile language which has applications in almost every field

-Artificial intelligence (AI)
-Machine Learning (ML)
-Big Data
-Smart Devices/Internet of Things (IoT)
-Cyber Security
-Game Development
-Backend Development, etc.
Career Opportunities:
Python developers have plenty of opportunities across the world

-DevOps Engineer
-Software Developer
-Data Analyst
-Data Scientist
-Machine Learning (ML) Engineer
-AI Scientist, etc.

Hello World Program in Python:
Here is a simple Python code that you can use to display the message "Hello World"

Code:
print("Hello World!")
Output:
Hello World!

Possible Mistakes:
Possible mistakes you may make while writing Python code to display the message "Hello World"

Spelling Mistake in print:
eg: prnt("Hello World!")

Uppercase ‘P’ in Print:
eg: Print("Hello World!")

Missing quotes:
eg: print(Hello World!)

Missing parentheses:
eg: print("Hello World!"

Printing Without Quotes:
If we want to print the numerical result of 2 + 5, we do not add quotes.

Code:
print(2 + 5)
Output:
7
If we want to print the exact message "2 + 5", then we add the quotes.
Code:
print("2 + 5")
Output:
2+5

Calculations with python:
Addition:

Addition is denoted by + sign.
It gives the sum of two numbers.

Code:
print(2 + 5) 
print(1 + 1.5)
Output:
7
2.5

Subtraction:

Subtraction is denoted by - sign.
It gives the difference between two numbers.

Code:
print(5 - 2)
Output:
3

Multiplication:

Multiplication is denoted by * sign.
Code:
print(2 * 5)
print(5 * 0.5)
Output:
10
2.5

Division:

Division is denoted by / sign.

Code:
print(5 / 2)
print(4/2)
Output:
2.5
2.0
