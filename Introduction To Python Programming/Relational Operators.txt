*Relational Operators*
Relational Operators are used to compare values.
Gives True or False as the result of a comparison.    

These are different relational operators    

Operator	Name
>	Is greater than
<	Is less than
==	Is equal to
<=	Is less than or equal to
>=	Is greater than or equal to
!=	Is not equal to

Code:
print(5 < 10)
print(2 > 1)
Output:
True
True

Possible Mistakes
Mistake - 1

Code:
print(3 = 3)
Output:
SyntaxError: expression cannot contain assignment, perhaps

Mistake - 2

Code:
print(2 < = 3)
Output:
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Space between relational operators ==, >=, <= , != is not valid in Python.

Comparing Numbers:
Code:
print(2 <= 3)  
print(2.53 >= 2.55)
Output:
True  
False

Comparing Integers and Floats:
Code:
print(12 == 12.0)  
print(12 == 12.1)
Output:
True  
False

Comparing Strings:
Code:
print("ABC" == "ABC")  
print("CBA" != "ABC")
Output:
True  
True
Case Sensitive
Code:
print("ABC" == "abc")
Output:
False

Python is case sensitive. 
It means X (Capital letter) and x (small letter) are not the same in Python.

Strings and Equality Operator:
Code:
print(True == "True")  
print(123 == "123")  
print(1.1 == "1.1")
Output:
False  
False
False
