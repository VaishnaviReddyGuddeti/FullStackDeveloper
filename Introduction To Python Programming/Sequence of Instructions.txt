*Sequence of Instructions*
Program:
A program is a sequence of instructions given to a computer.

Defining a Variable:
A variable gets created when you assign a value to it for the first time.

Code:
age = 10

Printing Value in a Variable
Code:
age = 10
print(age)
Output:
10

Code:
age = 10
print("age")
Output:
age

Variable name enclosed in quotes will print variable rather than the value in it.
If you intend to print value, do not enclose the variable in quotes.

Order of Instructions:
Python executes the code line-by-line.

Code:
print(age)
age = 10
Output:
NameError: name 'age' is not de

Variable age is not created by the time we tried to print.

Spacing in Python:
Having spaces at the beginning of line causes errors.

Code:
a = 10 * 5
b = 5 * 0.5
 b = a + b
Output:
File "main.py", line 3
    b = a + b
    ^
IndentationError: unexpecte

Variable Assignment:
Values in the variables can be changed.

Code:
a = 1
print(a)
a = 2
print(a)
Output:
1
2

Examples of Variable Assignment

Code:
a = 2
print(a)
a = a + 1
print(a)
Output:
2
3

Code:
a = 1
b = 2
a = b + 1
print(a)
print(b)

Output:
3
2

Expression:
An expression is a valid combination of values, variables and operators.

Examples :
    a * b
    a + 2
    5  2 + 3  4

BODMAS:
The standard order of evaluating an expression
- Brackets (B)
- Orders (O)
- Division (D)
- Multiplication (M)
- Addition (A)
- Subtraction (S)

Step by Step Explanation:
(5 * 2) + (3 * 4)
(10) + (12)
22

Code:
print(10 / 2 + 3)
print(10 / (2 + 3))
Output:
8.0
2.0
