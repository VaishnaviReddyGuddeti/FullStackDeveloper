*Conditional Statements*
Block of Code:
A sequence of instructions are called block of code.
Python executes code in a sequence.

Condition:
An expression that results in either True or False

Examples :

i. 2 < 3
ii. a == b
iii. True

Conditional Statement:
Conditional Statement allows you to execute a block of code only when a specific condition is True 

Conditional Block:
Block of code which executes only if a condition is True is called Conditional Block.

Indentation:
-Space(s) in front of the conditional block is called indentation.
-Indentation(spacing) is used to identify Conditional Block.
-Standard practice is to use four spaces for indentation.

Possible Mistakes:
Each statement inside a conditional block should have the same indentation (spacing).

Wrong Code:
if True:
    print("If Block")
            print("Inside If")
Output:
IndentationError: unexpected 

Correct Code:
if True:
    print("If Block")
    print("Inside If")

If - Else Syntax:
When If - Else conditional statement is used, Else block of code executes if the condition is False

Using If-Else
Code:
a = int(input())
if a > 0:  
    print("Positive")  
else:  
    print("Not Positive")  
print("End")
Intput: 2 
Output: 
Positive
End

Possible Mistakes in If-Else:
Else can only be used along with if condition. It is written below if conditional block  
Code:
if False:
    print("If Block")  
print("After If")  
else:  
    print("Else Block")  
print("After Else")
Output:
SyntaxError: invalid 

SingleLineWarning:
Warning:
Note: No code is allowed in between if conditional block and else statement.
